       Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was founded by four of the most brilliant witches and wizards of their time. It was founded in the 10th century by Godric Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw, Helga Hufflepuff and Salazar Slytherin. Each of them created a house in their names and thus established one of the best schools in the wizarding world. Many of the individuals in each house have similar traits or qualities as the original founders. Young witches and wizards receive their letters to Hogwarts at the mere age of 11 years old. Before beginning their schooling , each student must first be sorted into their correct houses by the magical Sorting Hat.</p>
